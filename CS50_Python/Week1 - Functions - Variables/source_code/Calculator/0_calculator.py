# This is a piece of code to demonstrate addition with python

# First we declare a variable called x, we are going to assign the value of 1 to the variable x
x = 1

# Then we declare variable y and assign value 2
y = 2

# Then we declare a variable called z and assign the value of the addtion x + y to the variable z
z = x + y

# Finally we print the variable z with the function print
print(z)
