---------------------DESCRIPTION--------------------------

In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user 
for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace 
should be outputted unchanged. Youâ€™re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, 
as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.e
"""


message = input("Hello please write your message here: ").lower()
print(f"Your message is: {message}")
